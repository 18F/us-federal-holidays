## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project!
If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull
request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to
change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff
follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its
[LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the
[18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository](https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy),
or just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

## Contributing

We take contributions via Github pull requests into this repo. In order to
create a pull request, you should first fork this repo into your own
organization or user account.

Make your changes to `index.js`. If you're changing or adding behaviors, modify
or add tests to `index.test.js`. Run your tests with `npm test`. Once your
changes are finished and all tests pass, commit all your changes and push them
to your fork and open a pull request into this repo. Be sure to update
`package.json` to add yourself to the list of contributors if you want!

When you open your pull request, please tell us a little about what you're
changing or adding so we can know what we're looking at. Someone from the
18F team will have to review the pull request before we can merge it which
might take a little while - please be patient with us!
